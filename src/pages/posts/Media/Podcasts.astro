        [I Thought I was Broken - I Just Had the Wrong Words|Alex Hormozi]</a>
	    - Jack Neel Podcast: Alex Hormozi views the world through a behavioralist lens, and describes how he manipulates his own behavior for increased output. 
	    During the episode, he refers to the idea that our behaviors are defined by our past behaviors that have been rewarded. He also discusses burnout, claiming that burnout isn't triggered by the volume of work alone, but by becoming habituated to its rewards, or when those rewards gradually lose their impact. Alex also discusses the initial inertia that fuels productive output. He notes that people have a variety of emotions and reasons for growing more productive, and essentially claims that it doesn't matter what that fuel is, as long as it's used for productive output.
