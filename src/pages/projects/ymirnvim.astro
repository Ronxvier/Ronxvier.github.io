		<p>This project started as an attempt to build a neovim theme plugin from scratch, but as I eventually learned that would be immensely impractical, with neovim colorschemes (specifically highlight groups) spanning across hundreds of lines.</p>
		<p>I ended up forking sunset.nvim, which had actually been forked from dracula.nvim prior. When building out this colorscheme, I found almost no comprehensive resources on how to build a neovim theme. mfs were genuinely out here talking about the aesthetics of different colors and how to build a color pallette but almost nobody was actually explaining what a vim highlight group was.</p>
		<p>It's for this reason that I wrote my first medium article, titled <a href="https://medium.com/@ronxvier/build-your-own-neovim-colorscheme-in-lua-3b01adf019e0">"Build Your Own Neovim Colorscheme in Lua"</a> which dives into the technical aspects of building your own colorscheme and later publishing on Github.</p>
